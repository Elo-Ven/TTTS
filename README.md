# Summary

If you are that sort of person that prefers listening to audiobooks over reading books, this mod will make Twine story games much more enjoyable for you.

Your web browser already has text-to-speech tools built into it right now. Your Twine game just isn't using them. This mod adds a small control panel to the game that hooks into those tools, letting you play the game, just as before, but now with voice-overs.

The mod is very simple to install and can also be added by anyone, developer or player.

# Download

If you are playing a Twine game, you will want to download the Gamer Version. If you are making a game then there are several versions available, check the Downloads page for the version most suitable for you.
