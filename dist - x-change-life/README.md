# TTTS - Twine Text To Speech - X-Change Life Version

Version: 2.4.0

# Summary

Reads story text aloud using your browsers in-built accessibility tools.

I highly recommend using a browser that has high quality text-to-speech voices. These can be download for Edge on Windows if not already installed by default.

# Modfied Version

This is a modified version of the main TTTS mod that is compatible with the `X-Change Life Mod Loader 1.2`.

In this version, the `.js` files have been moved into a singe `.twee` file and other files are provided in an `.xcl` to be compatible with the Mod Loaded

# Install

To install, download both the `ttts.twee` and `ttts.xcl` files and then import like any other X-Change Life mod (i.e. via the 'Add mods' button in the Mod Loader).

When you begin playing the game, you will see the player tools appear in the top right corner of the screen.

Alternatively, download the original TTTS mod and follow it's install instructions.
